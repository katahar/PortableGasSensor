# Instructions for Installing Pi Image

#### Image Update
 - Until I can get the image file hosted successfully, I have the latest version of the script under PortableGasSensor/Script 

#### Downloads
- Download the excelOutput.zip file and unzip to known location
- Download [Win32 Disk Imager](https://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/) and run
#### Installing the Image
- Insert the microSD card and determine the drive letter
- In the Disk Imager under "Image File", navigate to the image file, and choose the downloaded image
- Select the SD card drive letter under "Device"
  - Make sure you choose the correct one, so that you don't accidentally overwrite a different device 
- Click "Write".  This will upload the image to your SD card
- Insert the SD card into your Raspberry Pi and connect to a monitor to verify that the image was uploaded correctly
